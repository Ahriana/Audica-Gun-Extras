# Audica Gun Extras

This is a mod that aims (heh) at adding some gun related features. Right now we just have one, but in the future maybe we will have more! Make suggestions [here](https://github.com/MeepsKitten/Audica-Gun-Extras/issues/new)

# Current Features (well... feature)
* Custom Fire Point
  *You can add a custom "firepoint" to your guns. This will change the location the gun shoots from. [Here](https://github.com/MeepsKitten/Audica-Gun-Extras/blob/main/Examples/custom%20fire%20point%20example.txt) is an example of how to do it
